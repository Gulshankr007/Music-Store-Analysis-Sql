# Music-Store-Analysis-Sql


🎵 SQL Music Store Database Project
This project is a hands-on SQL analysis of a fictional music store database. It showcases the use of PostgreSQL and PgAdmin4 to answer real-world business questions using structured query language (SQL).

🧩 Project Overview
The Music Store database contains multiple interconnected tables that simulate a digital music store. The dataset includes customer information, invoices, tracks, genres, artists, playlists, and employees.

Using this schema, the project solves various analytical questions such as:

Identifying the senior-most employee

Analyzing invoice trends by country and city

Finding top customers and high-value purchases

Discovering music preferences across different regions

Determining the most popular genres and artists

⚙️ Tools & Technologies
